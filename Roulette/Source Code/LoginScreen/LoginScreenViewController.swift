ViewControllers normalmente tem uma sรณ view com varias subviews adicionadas รก ele.

A view controller is not drawable to the screen directly, it manages a group of view objects. View controllers usually have a single view with many subviews. The view controller manages the state of these views. A view controller is smart, and it knows how to interact with your application. It tells the dumb view objects what to do and how to show themselves.

For example: a screen that shows a list of users, an edit user form, a login screen.
