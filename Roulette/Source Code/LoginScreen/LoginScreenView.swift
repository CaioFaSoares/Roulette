/*
 
 A view is an object that is drawn to the screen. It may also contain other views (subviews) that are inside it and move with it. Views can get touch events and tell listeners or delegates about any events that occur in them. Views are dumb, and do not know about the structure of your application, and are simply told to display themselves in some state, and listened to for events.

 For example: a text label, a button, a checkbox, a progress bar.

class LoginScreenView: UIView {

    /*
    // Only override draw() if you perform custom drawing.
    // An empty implementation adversely affects performance during animation.
    override func draw(_ rect: CGRect) {
        // Drawing code
    }
    */
